### Just a standard demo front-end to-do list app.

## Features:

- Add and remove things to do

## Technologies used:

- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- JavaScript

## Libraries:

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

## Side Notes:

This small demo was developed in Colt Steel's - The Web Developer Bootcamp.

I'll probably be coming back to this demo and make a full functional app out of it just to practice.
